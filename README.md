# Screenshot Plugin for GLPI
Take a screenshot directly from GLPI and attach it to a ticket, change or problem. Only works from the timeline for now.

This plugin relies on some WebRTC features that are only available on a few browsers (Some features are still a working draft and not implemented into the W3C standard). It works on Chrome and should work on all other Chromium-based browsers (new Edge, Brave, etc), but doesn't work properly on Firefox.
