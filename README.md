# Screenshot Plugin for GLPI
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/cconard96/glpi-screenshot-plugin/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/cconard96/glpi-screenshot-plugin)

Take a screenshot or screen recording directly from GLPI and attach it to a ticket, change or problem. Only works from the timeline for now.

This plugin should work on any modern desktop browser, but it won't work on mobile browsers.

Additionally, browsers only expose this feature when it is being used over HTTPS (or running over localhost). If your GLPI server doesn't use HTTPS yet, this plugin will not work.
